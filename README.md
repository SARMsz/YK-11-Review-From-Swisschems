<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>I’ve tried a lot of SARMs, but YK‑11 from Swisschems stood out. It’s a selective androgen receptor modulator designed to boost muscle growth, strength, and bone health. I ordered the 5 mg capsules (60‑count) and ran a full cycle. Here’s my honest, hands‑on review.</p>

<h2>How I Tested and Ranked YK‑11</h2>
<p>My ranking system focuses on four key metrics:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Potency:</strong> Real strength and pump gains.</li>
  <li><strong>Purity:</strong> Third‑party lab tests for 98 %+ feedstock.</li>
  <li><strong>Value:</strong> Cost per mg versus effects.</li>
  <li><strong>Side Effects:</strong> Safety profile and manageability.</li>
</ul>
<p>I compared Swisschems YK‑11 to three other brands over a 4‑week period. I tracked my lifts, body weight, and muscle hardness. I also read user feedback on fitness forums to catch any common issues.</p>

<h2>My Personal Experience</h2>
<h3>Weeks 1–2: Early Signs</h3>
<p>I started at 5 mg daily, right after my morning workout. By day 7, I felt a mild but noticeable “full” muscle pump in shoulders and arms. My bench press went from 185 lb to 195 lb for reps. No harsh side effects—just a slight dry mouth.</p>

<h3>Weeks 3–4: Peak Gains</h3>
<p>By week 4, I added 10 lb to my squat and gained about 3 lb of lean mass on the scale. My body felt harder and more defined. Strength on deadlifts improved by 5 %. I kept water intake high and kept a multivitamin on hand for extra support.</p>
